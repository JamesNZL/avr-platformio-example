[platformio]
; Directory that is used to store compilation artifacts. Default is `.pio`,
; however this is hidden on Windows, so we change it to `build` so we can
; find our firmware in Proteus.

[env]

    platformio/tool-simavr

; The Xplained Mini boards you would have gotten from the ECE store have 2MHz
; clocks.
board_build.f_cpu = 2000000UL

; AVR simulation via simavr. Can be used for basic debugging (UART, logic etc).
; Doesn't support GPIO, ADC simulation out of the box, however simavr does
; support it if you want to dig into it.
;
; To run the simulator, press F5 in VSCode. It should start like a regular
; C/C++ debugging session.
;
; simavr does not support the ATmega328PB (which is what you have on your
; Xplained Mini boards), so we simulate using the ATmega328P - an earlier and
; very similar MCU. You shouldn't notice the difference.
;
; For a more advanced simulator, use Proteus. If you are on Linux or macOS you
; can use Proteus via FlexIT: <https://flexit.auckland.ac.nz>
