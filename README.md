By default, Microchip Studio installs `HID Input Device` drivers for the Xplained Mini.

These drivers are incompatible with `avrdude` (used by PlatformIO), which uses `libusb` to communicate with the Xplained Mini instead.

This guide details the process of using [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/) to replace the HID drivers.

> **Warning**  
> This process will result in Microchip Studio **no longer recognising the Xplained Mini as a connected device**, as we have replaced its Xplained Mini drivers.
>
> To revert these changes and restore Microchip Studio functionality, follow the steps detailed in [**Reverting Driver Changes**](#reverting-driver-changes).

1. Install [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/)

2. Click `Options` > `List All Devices`

3. Select `mEDBG CMSIS-DAP (Interface 0)`

4. Change the driver to `libusbK` or `libusb-win32`

5. Click `Replace Driver`

6. Try to upload with PlatformIO again

#### Reverting Driver Changes

To restore the original `HID Input Device` driver, follow the below steps.

1. Open `Device Manager` (`Win` + `x` > `m`)

2. Expand `libusbK USB Devices`
	> ![Device Manager screenshot](docs/update-driver.png)

3. Right click `mEDGB CMSIS-DAP (Interface 0)`

4. Click `Update driver`

5. Click `Browse my computer for drivers`
	> ![Browse my computer for drivers](docs/browse-for-drivers.png)

6. Search for drivers under `C:\Windows\INF` (including subfolders)
	> ![Search for drivers in this location](docs/let-me-pick-driver.png)

7. Click `Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer`

8. Click `USB Input Device`
	> ![USB Input Device driver](docs/usb-input-device.png)
	 
	> **Note**  
	> Select `mEDBG CMSIS-DAP (Interface 0)` here to re-configure the drivers for PlatformIO.

9.  Click `Next`

The Xplained Mini should then appear in Microchip Studio, and can be programmed as usual.
